Bio-Adaptive Media Player App and Sensor


Situation: According to the CDC, kids now spend 7.5 hours a day on screens. For
many such as those with autism this can lead to sensory overload where little learning
or engagement can occur. There is a need for improving engagement, focus, and
relaxation in sync with a personâ€™s biology especially in schools, healthcare, and
entertainment industries.


Action: User research was conducted to find needs and the data collected was
analyzed. Ideation led to a potential solution and a hardware / software solution was
developed that can optimize screen time media in real time by adapting music and
video elements based on heart data. UX testing was then conducted to evaluate the
invention and improvements were iterated forming a working product.


Results: A working prototype was developed to solve the initial problem by adapting
video to sync with bodily rhythm with calm or thrill boosts when optimal
